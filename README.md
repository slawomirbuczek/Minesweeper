# Minesweeper
A classic computer game. Popularized by Mincrosoft and loved by me since 2016.  
Written as my first android app. At the begining it was just a uni project.  
After some time I upgraded it with some new features.  
The game connects to my [Global Ranking](https://github.com/slawomirbuczek/Minesweeper-ranking).

## Current functionalities:
* game:
  * default minesweeper's mechanics;
  * three levels:
    * easy - 7 columns, 0.1 mines to fields ration;
    * medium - 8 columns, 0.15 mines to fields ration;
    * hard - 9 columns, 0.2 mines to fields ration;
  * local ranking;
* client:
  * registration & login;
  * each won game is automatically posted to global ranking;
  * global ranking - top 50 records; 

## Technology stack and its application in the project:
With this project I wanted to refresh my android skills.
SQLite is used for storing local records.
Spring for Anrdoid is used for REST template.
